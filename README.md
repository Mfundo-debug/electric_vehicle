# Electrical Vehicle Data (1997-2024)

## Project Description

-   This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) the source of the dataset is shared by the Us government below are the features of the dataset which are important to understand before working with the data.

#### Dataset information

-   [x] model year-\> in which year the car is launched or it will be launched.

-   [x] Make -\> manufacturing company name

-   [x] Model --\> Car Model Name

-   [x] Electric vehicle type --\> type of electric vehicle(Battery Electric Vehicle or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle )

-   [x] CAFV --\> refers to vehicles that qualify for certain incentives, benefits, or programs based on their use of clean or alternative fuels.

-   [x] Electric Range --\> The term "electric range" refers to the distance or the maximum range that an electric vehicle (EV) can travel on a fully charged battery before it needs to be recharged. It represents the total driving distance an EV can cover solely using the energy stored in its battery pack.
